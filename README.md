# CipherApp

This application includes many different symmetric encryption algorithms with a large number of settings and security levels. It was made by me as a diploma in the Python programming language:

The application contains the following encryption algorithms:
Blocks:
- AES
- DES
- 3DES
- BlowFish

Current:
- Salsa20
- ChaCha
- RC4

Block encryption algorithms have the following settings and security levels:
- Encryption key
- Initialization vector
- Key protection mode
- Key length (you can choose one or one of several lengths)
- Block-by-block mode
- Indentation mode

Stream encryption algorithms have the following settings:
- The key
- Initialization vector
- The length of the key
- Number of rounds (number of times the algorithm is executed)

Also, in addition to symmetric encryption algorithms, the application includes cryptanalysis methods (frequency analysis, full Caesar cipher analysis, factorization), and mathematical functions (search for prime numbers in a given interval, finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers, finding divisors of a number):
